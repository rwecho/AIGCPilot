This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Cloudflare R2 media storage (screenshots / logos / videos)

The crawler supports uploading media files directly to Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible).

### 1) Install crawler dependencies

```bash
pip install -r crawler/requirements.txt
playwright install
```

### 2) Configure environment variables

Add the following to `.env`:

- `R2_ENDPOINT_URL`
- `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `R2_BUCKET_NAME`
- `R2_REGION` (use `auto` for R2)
- `R2_PUBLIC_URL` (recommended: your CDN/custom domain)

If R2 vars are missing, crawler falls back to local `public` storage.

### 3) Run crawler

```bash
python crawler/main.py
```

Uploaded URLs are saved in `logo`, `screenshotUrl`, and `videoUrl` fields in database.
